Changes:

* Update misc.xml instead of overwrite to preserve non-sbt-idea generated settings stored in misc.xml (issue [#29][1])
* Create module also for ParentProject (issue [#24][2]) 
* Changed name of 'sbt\_project\_definition' module to reflect directory name ('project')
* Vcs.xml is not overridden anymore, just created if it does not exist (issue [#31][3])
* Source roots are now set from SBT configuration instead of using hard coded paths (issue [#33][4])
